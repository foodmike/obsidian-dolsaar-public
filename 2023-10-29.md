## Summary 
The party began late in the evening of Friday, August 25. The discovered the Standing Stones about halfway up a hillside in a wooded section of Tevurn. After examining the circular stone area between the stones [[Qualmea]] discovered the faint outline of what appeared to be hidden steps. This matched one of the visions she had while visting [[Ahnah Qeorvik]] in [[Highfort]]. 

While investigating the stones [[Atania]] found the vial hidden in the hilt of her dagger, based on clues she found on a piece of parchment discovered in the dungeons below [[VonWitteâ€™s Manor]]. She filled the vial with her blood discovered she has been carrying the [[Blade of Phlegethos]].

After some searching, the group attempted to read the ruins found on each of the stones out load. Upon doing this, the hidden stairs lowered into the earth, revealing an underground passage. The group descended into the earth and found themselves in a octagon shaped room that matched the one [[Atania]] has had visions of.

The room had a statue of a woman along the far wall, and behind her was carved a relief of scenes, presumably from Baator. It showed an army of fiends marching from a fortress, an erupting volcano, and caged devils hanging over a fiery pit.

Captivated by the statue, Atania approached it. In her mind she heard it speak to her, and extend a hand. It asked for the blade and for an oath to "Lord Belial and Lady Fierna."

Although clear in her mind, Atania did not take the oath and did not hand over her blade. In her mind the statue then admonished her for betraying her "blood and her destiny" and declared that her and her friends would not be permitted to live.

A  cloud of shadow and darkness formed in the center of the room, emanating cries and slurping sounds. Four shadowy forms emerged and attacked the group as the doors to the chamber began to close. Ominous attempted to dash from the room, but a shadow followed him and attacked. The party was able to defeat the forms, but not until after Ominous was knocked unconscious.

Once defeated, the cloud of darkness disappeared and the doors opened. [[Qualmea]] was able to stabilize [[Ominous]] and the group rested above ground.
