## Summary 

The party finishes up at [[VonWitte’s Manor]] by burning the bodies of VonWitte and his zombies. They then bury Serafan's body in the graveyard in front of the statue of Ehlonna.

They spend the night at the manor and then set out to [[Eastbet]]. Upon their arrival they meet a crowd of towns people. They warn the villagers of the oncoming hoard. Later, a group of half giants arrive from Skorfell. They warn the party that a man named [[Quintus]] arrived there on 0092-08-09 and somehow convinced the town elders prepare for the arrival of the oncoming hoard and to side with them.

The next day the party departed for the standing stones in Tevurn, following the [[Map of Tevurn]](map) that they found in VonWitte’s manor.
